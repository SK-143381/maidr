  "description": "MAIDR is a system for non-visual access and control of statistical charts. It aims to provide an inclusive experience for users with visual impairments by offering multiple modes of interaction: sonification, braille, and text. This innovative approach enhances the accessibility of data visualization and encourages a multi-model exploration on visualization. Check out the current build: [MAIDR Demo](https://uiuc-ischool-accessible-computing-lab.github.io/MAIDR/user_study_pilot/intro.html).",
